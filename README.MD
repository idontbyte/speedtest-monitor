# Intro

This was an iGoCode Code Club 2.5 hour session with the aim to regularly run speedtest.exe and report on the results.
In the future we may enhance with interval customisation, run dates and filtering the results to the lowest / highest and so on.

# Requirements

  - Windows 
  - Node.js

# Instructions

  - place speedtest.exe windows binary in src folder
  - run npm install
  - execute command 'npm start' to run
  - execute command 'npm run make' to build
